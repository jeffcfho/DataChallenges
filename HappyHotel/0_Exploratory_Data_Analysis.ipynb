But our real nightmare started at after -am midnight- since we have a minor surgery at USCF centre the next day, we went to bed a bit earlier, but after past mid night- we were woke up by the running water and heavy foot steps from upstairs, then leaking water in the bathroom--- minutes later, we heard loud repair work, with chain-sawing and drilling noises from upstairs at almost -:--am!!!!! We then have to call downstairs customer services asking what\\'s going on, at first, no response- answer for ehat\\'s about, quickly few minutes later, same lady call back saying repair work need to be done, and the option for us is to \\' move to another room\\' if we like\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" -- we requested for manager...

Of course, the manager never showed up nor called back, only the same lady, called back- after a few rounds phone calls and complains, the \\'work\\' finally stopped- then we got even calls from repairman at mid of night to wanting look at bathroom leakage.... The end, everything finally gone peace at around -am -- we woke up again the next morning, but door knock - eventually we put out \\' do not disturb \\' to rest some- of course, we were late for the hospital but manage to be okay- we checked out the hotel right after wards, to our very surprise- we never even receive a note nor any apology from hotel management about a near nightmare experience!!!

Granted they said to call for anything that was not there, but no shower cap? Just seemed odd.\\r\\nLeather wrapped platform bed was not the most comfortable.

Sure they have it in the lobby, but if you want a cup at -am when getting up you\\'d have to get dressed, go to the elevator and head down there and hope they have some made.

The lobby is cool, and checkin was quick and friendly (not as pretentious like the average W hotel). The rooms are very small, but this isn't a problem due to a clever layout, big windows, lighting, and mirrors. The design reminds me a bit of a youth hostel, however if you have enough of over designed hotels, then it's is refreshingly simple and functional. The first room (----) had a very loud ventilation, however the second room (----) was even worse. Since it was windy outside, somehow some flaps in the ventilation system made a loud hammering noise that prevented me from sleeping. Was too tired to change it again. I had dinner at the Standard Grill (my second visit, just ok as they barbecued the scallops without any spices or seasoning, the worst scallops in a long time, and the most expensive, too). The bar at the --th floor is phantastic, cool design, good crowd, great view. Since I left at -:-- am next morning I placed an order for room service breakfast at -:--. I was informed that room service won't start until -:--, despite being told at checkin that they have -- hour room service. They finally agreed that they could only do an omelette with a filling different to what I ordered (god knows why), however finally delivered the omelette I had originally ordered. The coffee was on the house for the trouble caused (however without spoon to stir the sugar). Still better choice than the Gansevoort, but wouldn't return.\"\n",
